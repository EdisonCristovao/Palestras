CAESAR CIPHER

Your goal is to implement the encrypt and decrypt methods of a caesar cipher.

You have to implement 2 methods, one to encrypt a message, and another to decrypt an encrypted message. Both of them will receive a string, that is the message, and an integer, which is the key that represents how much the alphabet will be shifted.
